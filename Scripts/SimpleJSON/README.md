A simple JSON Parser / builder
------------------------------

It mainly has been written as a simple JSON parser. It can build a JSON string
from the node-tree, or generate a node tree from any valid JSON string.

If you want to use compression when saving to file / stream / B64 you have to include
SharpZipLib ( http://www.icsharpcode.net/opensource/sharpziplib/ ) in your project and
define "USE_SharpZipLib" at the top of the file

Features / attributes:
- provides strongly typed node classes and lists / dictionaries
- provides easy access to class members / array items / data values
- the parser now properly identifies types. So generating JSON with this framework should work.
- only double quotes (") are used for quoting strings.
- provides "casting" properties to easily convert to / from those types:
  int / float / double / bool
- provides a common interface for each node so no explicit casting is required.
- the parser tries to avoid errors, but if malformed JSON is parsed the result is more or less undefined
- It can serialize/deserialize a node tree into/from an experimental compact binary format. It might
  be handy if you want to store things in a file and don't want it to be easily modifiable


2012-12-17 Update:
- Added internal JSONLazyCreator class which simplifies the construction of a JSON tree
  Now you can simple reference any item that doesn't exist yet and it will return a JSONLazyCreator
  The class determines the required type by it's further use, creates the type and removes itself.
- Added binary serialization / deserialization.
- Added support for BZip2 zipped binary format. Requires the SharpZipLib ( http://www.icsharpcode.net/opensource/sharpziplib/ )
  The usage of the SharpZipLib library can be disabled by removing or commenting out the USE_SharpZipLib define at the top
- The serializer uses different types when it comes to store the values. Since my data values
  are all of type string, the serializer will "try" which format fits best. The order is: int, float, double, bool, string.
  It's not the most efficient way but for a moderate amount of data it should work on all platforms.
  
2017-03-08 Update:
- Optimised parsing by using a StringBuilder for token. This prevents performance issues when large
  string data fields are contained in the json data.
- Finally refactored the badly named JSONClass into JSONObject.
- Replaced the old JSONData class by distict typed classes ( JSONString, JSONNumber, JSONBool, JSONNull ) this
  allows to propertly convert the node tree back to json without type information loss. The actual value
  parsing now happens at parsing time and not when you actually access one of the casting properties.

2017-04-11 Update:
- Fixed parsing bug where empty string values have been ignored.
- Optimised "ToString" by using a StringBuilder internally. This should heavily improve performance for large files
- Changed the overload of "ToString(string aIndent)" to "ToString(int aIndent)"
